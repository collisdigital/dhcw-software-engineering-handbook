# General good practice

**You **MUST** store T-SQL scripts and database code in source control as a
'single source of truth. '**

You **SHOULD**: -

-   **Check your SQL application is performant. You may find your
    support team or Database Administrator (DBA)** may be able to help.

-   Review your code to address any issues, such as performance and
    security considerations.

-   **Share code using code snippets and a common repository.**

-   Conform to ANSI standards wherever possible.

-   Prefer CAST to CONVERT

-   Prefer SET to SELECT when assigning variables.

-   Prefer COALESCE to ISNULL

-   **Format and analyse your code using SQL Prompt before checking into
    source control.**

-   **Configure SQL Prompt using our config files. See** [SQL Prompt
    configuration](#_SQL_Prompt_configuration) **for help.**

**You **SHOULD NOT**: -**

-   Use deprecated features.

-   Use dynamic SQL. If you cannot avoid this then call it using
    sp_executesql rather than the EXECUTE statement.

-   Expect your DBA to performance tune your queries but do ask them for
    advice. Particularly what tools to use.

-   Use undocumented stored procedures.

-   **Create objects that flout the single responsibility pattern. Such
    as: -**

1.  **Entity-attribute-value tables.**

2.  **Generic stored procedures with no specific (or multiple) use
    > cases.**

3.  **Using a single table to hold all lookup values, metadata, and
    > domain or reference data.**

    **WPRS -- Prioritisation incident**

    In 2016, a failure to run SQL code analysis checks and deploy from source control prevented referrals including those for urgent suspected cancer being actioned.

    **WPRS -- WPAS (Welsh Patient Administration System) delayed Urgent Suspected Cancer referral.**

    In 2017, a failure to deploy the correct stored procedure led to a delay in referring a patient with urgent suspected cancer.
