# What to include in source control

You **MUST** include:

-   Everything needed to build your project, including the database.

-   A README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file. Other documentation **MAY** be
    > kept outside source control.

You **MUST NOT** include:

-   Sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or server names.
    Instead, use environment variables or key stores.

-   Personal Identifiable Information (PII).

You **SHOULD** exclude:

-   Compilation output and user settings files. Use a .gitignore file
    > (e.g., for Visual Studio) to manage exclusions.

Additional **RECOMMENDATIONS**:

-   Use Redgate Source Control to manage your database.

-   Use package management to avoid storing dependencies in source
    > control.
